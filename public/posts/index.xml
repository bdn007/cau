    <description><![CDATA[<p>I am using an old iMac, very old indeed. This iMac13,1 was discontinued in Sep 2013, so it is at least 12 years old. It stopped working before COVID time, I had to revive it by installing Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Today I learned two new commands, they are <code>neofetch</code> and <code>fastfetch</code>, the <code>neofetch</code> looks better in my opinion, what do you think?</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Non-Lucrative allows you to reside in Spain without undertaking any economic activity. Applicants must dispose of enough economic means to cover their expenses in Spain. These amount to: â‚¬2.400 for the main applicant and â‚¬600 for each accompanying family member per month.</p>
<p>If you do not receive these amounts on a monthly basis, it is also possible to show that amount times twelve as a lump sum in a bank account to show that you can cover your expenses in Spain.</p>]]></description>
