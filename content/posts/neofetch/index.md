I am using an old iMac, very old indeed. This iMac13,1 was discontinued in Sep 2013, so it is at least 12 years old. It stopped working before COVID time, I had to revive it by installing Ubuntu.

Today I learned two new commands, they are `neofetch` and `fastfetch`, the `neofetch` looks better in my opinion, what do you think?
