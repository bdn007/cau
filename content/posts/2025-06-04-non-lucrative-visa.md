The Non-Lucrative allows you to reside in Spain without undertaking any economic activity. Applicants must dispose of enough economic means to cover their expenses in Spain. These amount to: €2.400 for the main applicant and €600 for each accompanying family member per month. 

If you do not receive these amounts on a monthly basis, it is also possible to show that amount times twelve as a lump sum in a bank account to show that you can cover your expenses in Spain.

## Timeline
The process starts with a consulate in your country of legal residence, and it takes roughly four months until you will have your visa in hand which allows you to travel to Spain. See the timeline in below:
